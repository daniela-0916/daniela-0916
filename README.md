## Hi there 👋 I'm Daniela!

I'm a bilingual administrative professional transitioning into tech.
I’ve always loved finding smarter, easier ways to work — improving processes, saving time, and keeping things organized!

I'm *that* curious person who always asks “why?” — sometimes too many “whys” 🫣  
But understanding *how* things work is what keeps me going. If I don’t get it, I can’t just move on — my brain won’t let me!  

For the longest time, I didn’t share any of my projects because I thought they had to be perfect first.  
But waiting for perfection was just keeping me stuck.  

So here I am — finally jumping in 🎉  
This is my little corner to share my *real* progress — from super beginner projects to (hopefully) something amazing down the road.
