## Hi there 👋 I'm Daniela!

I’m a bilingual Operations and Administrative professional transitioning into tech.
I’ve always loved finding smarter, more efficient ways to work — organizing information, improving processes, and saving time.

I’m the curious type who constantly asks “why?” because understanding how things work is what motivates me.
For a long time, I avoided sharing anything because I felt my projects weren’t “perfect.”
But perfection was only keeping me stuck, so here I am, finally jumping in! 🎉

This GitHub is where I’ll document my progress, from super beginner to (hopefully) something amazing!
